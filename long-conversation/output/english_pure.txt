["M: Hi, Jennifer.","I’m really struggling with this semester’s workload.","Do you have any advice?","W:  Have you considered making a study guide?","It’s a tool you can make yourself to take the stress out of studying.","I’ve been using one since the start of last semester, and it has really helped relieve a lot of study pressure.","M: Sounds like just what I need.","My main problem is that my study folder is full of notes and worksheets, and is badly disorganized.","I don’t know where to start.","W: Okay.","Well, the main thing is to have everything in the right place.","Whatever you’re reviewing, it’s important that it’s arranged for your particular needs of that subject, and in the most user-friendly way you can.","What kind of learner are you?","M: Um, I’m not sure.","W: Well, visual learners prefer using images, pictures, colors and maps to organize information.","Logical learners have a linear mind and would rather use logic, reasoning and systems.","I’m an emotional learner, which means I need to connect to information emotionally to understand it.","M: Oh!","I’m very much dependent on vision as a way of taking in information.","W:  Well, I suggest reorganizing your notes using color-coded sections in your study guides, or using idea mapping to lay out the information and make it more quickly accessible.","M: So you think I should arrange my notes using color and pictures in place of text.","W: Yes, you’ll probably start to grasp information a lot quicker that way.","As an emotional learner, I organize my notes into a story that I can connect to and recite to myself.","M: That’s amazing.","I didn’t know there were so many different ways to learn.","Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.","Question 12 What does the woman advise the man do?","Question 13 What is the biggest problem the man has with his studies?","Question 14 What kind of learner does the woman say she is?","Question 15 What does the woman think the man can do with his notes?"]
