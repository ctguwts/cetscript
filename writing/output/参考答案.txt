"<p>Application</p><p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p><p>I’m writing to apply for a position of our university’s volunteer teaching in remote rural areas. </p><p>My reasons are as follows. Firstly, through volunteer teaching, I hope to teach the students in remote rural areas knowledge I have acquired to make a modest contribution to the education cause in these areas. Secondly, the conditions in remote rural areas are usually difficult, so volunteer teaching can develop my willpower, which is of great benefit to my future development. Thirdly, I have large knowledge reserves and rich experience in education. Specifically, I have won the first-class scholarship for three consecutive years and served as a teaching assistant for two years, which can enable me to convey scientific learning methods to the students and stimulate their learning enthusiasm with advanced teaching concepts. Finally, I have a strong sense of responsibility and the ability to work under pressure. No matter what difficulties I meet, I will never give up halfway.</p><p>I would be grateful if you could consider my application. Looking forward to your reply.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Li Ming</p>"
