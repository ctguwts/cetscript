["如果你在杂货店购物时看过配料表，你很可能看到过“天然香辛料”这个词","但你有没有花时间想过这些天然香辛料到底是什么？","<br></br>","我们大多数人可能会认为“天然香辛料”自然对我们有好处","《食欲》杂志最近的一项研究发现，当“天然”一词出现在包装上时，人们会认为里面的食物确实更健康","事实上，至少从化学角度来说，天然香辛料与对应的增强风味的人造香辛料并没有太大区别","这两种香辛料都可以在实验室里由训练有素的调味师制作，但人工香辛料使用化学物质使产品具有特定的气味或味道","<br></br>","天然香辛料来自植物或动物，如水果、蔬菜、肉、鱼或奶，然后以某种方式加工或精炼","简而言之，天然香辛料是从植物和动物中提取的，为加工食品创造特定的味道","但这未必会让你更容易分辨出食物中真正的成分","由于美国食品和药品管理局（FDA）没有定义这个词，公司可以用它来指代几乎任何从植物或动物中提取的东西","天然香辛料也可以包括各种化学添加剂，如防腐剂","FDA并没有要求公司披露某个特定的产品中包含哪些额外的化学物质","<br></br>","所以，如果你想确切知道你买的东西是什么，你可能会想去农贸市场","<br></br>"]["If you’ve ever <em>looked at</em> the ingredients list while grocery shopping, chances are you’ve seen the term “natural flavors”.","But have you taken a <u id=26>26</u> to consider what these natural flavors actually are?","<br></br>","Most of us might think that “natural flavors” are, well, naturally good for us.","A recent study in the journal Appetite found that when the word “natural” appears on packaging, people <u id=27>27</u> that the food within is indeed healthier.","In truth, natural flavors do not <u id=28>28</u> much, <em>at least</em> chemically speaking, from their flavor-boosting <u id=29>29</u>: artificial flavors.","Both can be made in a lab by trained flavorists, but artificial flavors use chemicals to give a product a <u id=30>30</u> smell or taste.","<br></br>","Natural flavors <em>come from</em> plant or animal <u id=31>31</u>, like fruit, vegetable, meat, fish or milk that is then processed or refined in some way.","<em>In short</em>, natural flavors are <u id=32>32</u> from plants and animals to create specific flavors for processed foods.","But that does not <u id=33>33</u> make it easier to tell what is really in your food.","Because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not <u id=34>34</u> the term, companies can use it to <em>refer to</em> pretty much anything <em>derived from</em> a plant or animal.","And natural flavors can also include <em>a variety of</em> chemical additives, <em>such as</em> preservatives.","The FDA doesn’t require companies to reveal what additional chemicals a specific item <u id=35>35</u>.","<br></br>","So if you want to know <em>for certain</em> what you’re getting with your groceries, you might want to <em>stick to</em> the farmer’s market.","<br></br>","<br></br>"]
